                <a href="http://">From Wikipedia</a>
                <p>CascadingStyle Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                    MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                    JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
                    the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
                    pages that share the file and its formatting.
